# InsightNexus

## Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-based solution that can effectively represent knowledge and generate insights from any structured dataset. The solution processes and analyzes structured data, identifies patterns, and generates meaningful insights to aid in decision-making processes.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory for storing dataset files (if applicable).
- `src/`: Directory containing source code files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training.
- `models/`: Directory for storing trained models.
- `reports/`: Directory for storing the project report and any generated visualizations.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies and packages required to run the project.
- `scripts/`: Any additional scripts for data preprocessing, model evaluation, etc.
